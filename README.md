Patient Pain States

This code serves as pseudocode and example code for the paper "Defining and validating a multidimensional digital metric of health states in chronic back and leg pain" by Reinen et al. 

Taking from specific lines in the Methods Section and in the Supplement, such code can be created and edited.

This is intended to serve as a conceptual guide for our thought process and should be amended substantially when used with real data to accommodate the specifications of each study.
